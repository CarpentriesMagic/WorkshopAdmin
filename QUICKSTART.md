# Getting started with CarpentriesMagic WorkshopAdmin

1. Clone this repository to your local drive: `git clone git@github.com:CarpentriesMagic/WorkshopAdmin.git`
1. Copy the config file: `cp includes/db_config.inc.def includes/db_config.inc`
1. Change the second line of the config file. If you want to use the sql database change it to `sql`, otherwise, leave it as `csv`. If you decide to use sql then you also need to update the other config lines to point to the correct host, database, user and password.
